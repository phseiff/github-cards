# Unofficial GitHub Cards - without google analytics!

This is a fork of the Unofficial Github Cards project, which adds the following 1 1/2 game changers:

1. The original Unofficial Github Cards uses Google Analytics (though I myself don't know why), which some people might
consider complicated.

2. The codesnippets for the cards generated by the original Unofficial Github Pages embed code from jsdelivr.net. This
means that, due to cross origin policies (CORS requests), javascript embedded in your page can not access or change the
github cards emedded in your page. This is a problem if you are for example embedding code from the darkreader project
to give your page a darkmode, because your github cards will still be light. However, this fork uses javascript hosted 
on github (in this repository), which means you can fork this repository, host it with github pages somewhere on your
website, and replace https://phseiff.com/github-cards in each cards code with the place where you host the repo on your
website, and bam!, you no longer have to worry about CORS requests having to be made to access the content of the cards!

If you are into graphics and don't believe the first point, here are two screenshots:
